## 🔐 Cookie Management and GDPR

The project includes a cookie management system designed to comply with GDPR principles (EU Regulation 2016/679). On the first visit, a banner informs users about cookie usage and allows them to choose between different options: accept all cookies, reject non-essential ones, or customize preferences. The selected preferences are saved in the browser using LocalStorage, allowing the site to remember them for future visits.

A key aspect is that any tracking scripts or external services are activated only after explicit user consent, in compliance with European regulations. There is also a dedicated Cookie Policy page, accessible from the site, which explains in detail the types of cookies used and how consent is managed.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

To run the project, simply clone the repository: https://github.com/tommyguerini07/progetto-GPOI-5INFB-Guerini-Bertasa-Mutti-Zecchini from GitHub using the `git clone` command on your command prompt.

## 📚 Future Developments

The project will be further expanded with additional features, including the creation of an administrative dashboard and the implementation of advanced analytics systems in full compliance with GDPR, we will implement other databases with the user and player data following our cookie policy. The user interface can also be improved, along with a more advanced cookie preference management system through a dedicated modal.
